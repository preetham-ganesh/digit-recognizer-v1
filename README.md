## Description

- An application for recognizing hand written digits (0-9) using Convolutional Neural Networks.

## Dataset

- The data was downloaded from Kaggle - Digit Recognizer competition [[Link]](https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data).
- Due to the size of the data, it is not available in the repository.
- After downloading the data, it should be saved in the data folder with the sub-folder named 'original_data'.
- The ZIP file downloaded using the above link, will have 2 CSV files, namely, Train and Test, which should be extracted and saved in the 'original_data' folder.

## Usage

### Requirement Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install requirements.

Requires: Python 3.6.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/preetham-ganesh/digit-recognizer-v1.git
cd digit-recognizer-v1

# Create a Conda environment with dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate dr_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Model Training and Testing

- Two types of models can be trained using the repository.
- The configuration dictionary in the model_training_testing.py code file has a key called 'model,' which can take values as either 1 or 2.
- It can be changed by providing an argument while training the models.

```bash
python3 model_training_testing.py 1
```

or

```bash
python3 model_training_testing.py 2
```

### Running the application

A video demonstration on how to run the application is shown below:

## Future Work

- Due to computational complexities, the application is executed on localhost.
- In the future, the application will be modified for hosting on an ML cloud server such as AWS or Google Cloud.
